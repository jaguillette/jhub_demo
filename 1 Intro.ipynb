    "This here is a code notebook. It's broken into discrete units called \"cells\". These cells can serve different purposes. This cell is called a ***Markdown cell***, because it doesn't contain code, it has text that uses something called markdown syntax. You can think of markdown as a kind of \"HTML lite\", since it uses special characters to change text formatting, but doesn't have the complexity of regular HTML. For example, to make something a title, you type `# Title` on a line in a markdown cell, instead of the HTML equivalent, `<h1>Title</h1>`\n",

Each code cell that runs changes the environment of the notebook, so that if you create a variable in one cell, you can change it in another. That is, the cells aren't independent of one another, they all interact within the same broader notebook environment.\n",

    "* You can click on the <i class=\"fa-step-forward fa\"></i> button in the bar above the notebook, which runs a cell and selects the cell below, so you can just keep clicking it to run through an entire notebook.\n",
    "* You can use a keyboard shortcut:\n",
    "    * `Ctrl + Enter` runs code in a cell and keeps the same cell active, so you can keep re-running the same code by hitting `Ctrl + Enter` many times.\n",
    "    * `Shift + Enter` does the same thing as the <i class=\"fa-step-forward fa\"></i> button, in that it runs code and selects the next cell\n",
    "    * `Alt/Option + Enter` runs the code in the cell, and then inserts a new empty cell below it.\n",

You don't have to run cells in a notebook in order, so you can run a cell from the bottom, then one from the top, then one from the middle. If you're using a notebook to experiment with a new tool or data set, you might find yourself jumping around the notebook, and these numbers help you keep track of what's happened when."

    "This mode is a bit less intuitive, but very useful if you work in the notebook environment a lot. You can tell that you're in command mode because you'll see a blue border around the active cell. In command mode, different keys on your keyboard will let you execute different commands in the notebook, like adding or deleting cells or changing the type of the cell you're editing from code to markdown. In command mode, you can hit the `H` key to bring up a help menu of keyboard shortcuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shortcuts in command mode let you work more efficiently, and once you get used to them, they let you focus on the content of the notebook instead of a series of menus. For example, if I want to add a new cell below this one and make it a markdown cell, I can hit `Esc`, `B`, `M`, then `Enter` and start typing. That's instead of going to the menu and clicking `Insert > Insert Cell Below`, then `Cell > Cell type > Markdown`, then double clicking in the cell."
